Devastate is an upcoming game combining various destruction games and realism, currently unpaid due to me living in iran, Languages include English, Polish, Italian, and Turkish, with upcoming updates.
Project: Devastate

Summary:
Devastate is a Unity-based disaster simulation game where players can Simulate various realistic events such as: explosions, fires, building collapse, and other chain reactions. across dynamic city environments.  
The goal of the game is not just destruction, but analysis: tracking damage, civilian response, and impact on infrastructure.

---

Core Gameplay:
- Sandbox-style gameplay with tools to trigger and simulate disasters.  
- Realistic simulation of buildings, cars, and NPC behavior.  
- Cinematic aftermath analysis (VDRS system).  
- Expansion plans include city-building and emergency management mechanics.

---

Scope & Goals:
Short-term goals:
- Create small demo scenes (fire test, building collape, explosion chain, etc.).  
- Add basic UI (timer, restart, pause).  
- Experiment with camera angles and destruction physics.

Long-term goals:
- Full-scale simulation with procedural cities and AI responses.  
- Modding support and international localization.
